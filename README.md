###### Project is still in progress

## Idea Behind the Project
### Making transcript of every episode for one of the most popular TV shows in the region "Dr≈æavni Posao" (eng. smth. like "Government Job"). There is no similar project nor dataset out there. 

## Goal
### Possibilities are unlimited, for both analysis and general curiosity. 
#### Do you want to find your favorite joke? 
- Just search through the dataset.
#### Wanna watch all the occurrences of a certain character?
- Again, just search through the dataset
#### Interested in making any data analysis of the show?
- Once more, just go through the dataset.

## Help of the Community
### There is a certain possibility that this "one man" project would be done in 1-2 years.
### This is an open-source project, any help from the community is welcome.

## Methodology
### So far, one of the working steps would be the following:
- Scrape titles and links of each episode from YouTube. (Scrapy)
- Download each episode using manually or using automation. (Selenium)
- Upload episode/Provide a link to the 3rd party tool which would generate a transcript of the episode, manually or with automation. (Selenium)
- Store episodes and extract valuable data from them into the main dataset.

### _About future contributions_: Guidelines and detailed documentation will be uploaded in the near future.
